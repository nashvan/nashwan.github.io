#### Welcome to My Homepage

A Senior Platform Engineer with extensive 13 years of experience working in ITIL environments, with primary focus on DevSecOps, AWS and GCP cloud, Kubernetes, multi-organisation,  multi-tenant platform environment, CICD, automation, cloud security, cloud migration and re-architecture, kubernetes, contairs, EKS, GKE, service mesh, and serverless.

#### Technologies and toolings I Worked with:
- Cloud: AWS, GCP, Azure
- Infrastructure Services: DNS, DHCP, Web, DB, Nginx, NAT, IDP/IPS, Proxy, NAT, Routers, Edge Firewalls
- DevOps and GitOps: Kubernetes, GitHub, Docker, Terraform, Golang, Python, Bash, FluxCD, Jenkins, Codefrehs
- Cloud and K8S Security: Istio Service Mesh, AWS SCP, AWS Network FW, NACLs, AWS SG, K8S netpolicy, Gatekeeper, Calico Global Network Policy for K8S.
- Cloud and K8S Network: VPC, Sbnets, TGW, TGW peering, AWS Direct Connect, Routing table, ALB, NLB, K8s services, Istio, Nginx Ingress. 

#### Recent Projects and Accomplishments
- Lead both EKS and AWS platform teams and their tenants to engineer and test solutions to deliver large and/or complex enhancements and changes, where the problem space may be ambiguous and lacking existing patterns
- Provide direction and guidance to K8S and AWS cloud customers to ensure delivery, security and operational risks are identified.  Help others to identify and deliver appropriate cloud features, controls, or mitigations including risks to other parts of the organisation
- Designed a secure architecture leveraging AWS PrivateLink to provide private connectivity between the non-organisation AWS accounts and local tenant of EKS platform from the organisation.
- Architected and Implemented AWS VPC endpoints and endpoint services, ensuring seamless and secure communication without exposing sensitive data over the public internet.
- Utilized Kubernetes Ingress controllers and service meshes (istio) to route traffic securely and efficiently within the EKS cluster, maintaining low latency and high availability.
- DevOps Architecture: Designed and implemented comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for EKS platform on codefresh using Terraform. These pipelines automated code compilation, testing, deployment, and rollback processes, ensuring consistent and reliable delivery. The main objective was to deliver large-scale and complex enhancements.
- GitOps Development with fluxCD: implemented comprehensive GgitOps for deploying EKS platform components into EKS clusters using fluxCD. This automatically deploy the latest change to the git repo into the clusters, it sync with the repo on a timely bases to ensure the actual state should be synchronised with the desired state declared in GitHub.
- Automated Testing: Integrated automated testing at various stages, including unit tests, integration tests, and security scans, to catch issues early in the development cycle. Implemented static code analysis tools to enforce coding standards and detect potential vulnerabilities
- Identify and implement automation opportunities to reduce operational toil by using Helm charts as OCI (Open Container Initiative) images, pushing them to (ECR), and guiding a team to adopt and deliver the required uplift.
